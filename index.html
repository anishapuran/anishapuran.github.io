Inside you will find $1.7 billion dollars worth of stores, food, and lush trees and bushes and a magestic waterfall that continues to flow down all the levels of the jewel.</P>

     <p>Singapore is a place that at times, seems to be a land out of a fairytale. A place that really goes hand in hand with sentence previous is <strong>Gardens By the Bay</strong>. The gardens are a certainly a sight for sore eyes and an unforgetable experience. When daylights gone, the gardens are lit beautifully, a truly magical scene.</p>
